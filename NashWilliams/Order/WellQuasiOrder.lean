# Perfect/bad dichotomy and monotone subsequences in a well-quasi-order

The infinite Ramsey theorem for pairs gives a clean "perfect or bad" dichotomy for sequences in
any relation, from which the *monotone subsequence* property of a well-quasi-order follows
**without any transitivity assumption**.

## Main results

* `Sequences.perfect_or_bad`: every sequence has a subsequence that is either *perfect* (all
  earlier terms `r`-below all later ones) or *bad* (no earlier term `r`-below a later one). Pure
  consequence of `infinite_ramsey_pairs`; needs no order axioms.
* `WellQuasiOrdered.exists_monotone_subseq_lt`: in a WQO, every sequence has a strictly increasing
  reindexing along which `r` holds for all pairs `m < n`. No typeclass assumptions.

The second result answers a question of Leo Shine on the Mathlib Zulip: the monotone-subsequence
property of a WQO does not need the preorder (in particular transitivity) hypothesis carried by
the current Mathlib `WellQuasiOrdered.exists_monotone_subseq`.
