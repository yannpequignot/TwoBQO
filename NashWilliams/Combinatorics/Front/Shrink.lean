# Restricting a front to an infinite subset

Given a front `F` on `M` and an infinite subset `N ⊆ M`, the restriction `F ↾ N`
(`Front.shrink F N`) keeps the elements of `F` all of whose entries lie in `N`. When `N = M ∘ E`
is an infinite subset of `M` (`E : ℕ → ℕ` strictly monotone), `shrink F N` is a front on `N`.
This is one of the two operations (with the ray, see `Fronts.Ray`) needed for the Nash-Williams
theorem.

`shrink F N` is in fact *the* subfront of `F` living on `N`: every subfront arises this way, i.e.
if `F' ⊆ F` is itself a front on `N`, then `F' = shrink F N`. (This characterization is not
formalized here.)

## Main definitions

* `Front.shrink F N` : the elements of `F` whose entries lie in `range N`.

## Main results

* `Front.shrink_isFront` : `shrink F (M ∘ E)` is a front on `M ∘ E`.
