# The ray of a front

Given a front `F` on `M` and a node `[a]` of its tree (i.e. `a` is the least element of some
element of `F`), the *ray* `F after a` (terminology from the author's EMS survey *Towards better:
A motivated introduction to better-quasi-orders*) is the front obtained by stripping the leading
`a` from the elements of `F` that start with `a`. It is a front on `M after a`, the infinite set
`{n ∈ M : n > a}`, itself represented enumeration-first as the subsequence `M ∘ (· + j)` where
`j` is the least index at which `M` passes `a`.

("Ray" is not to be confused with the *derivative*, the tree-to-tree leaf-removal operation whose
iteration computes the rank.)

## Main definitions

* `rayEnum M a` : the enumeration `M ∘ (· + afterShift M a)` of `{n ∈ M : n > a}` (front-
  independent).
* `Front.ray F a` : the ray `{t | a :: t ∈ F}`.

## Main results

* `Front.ray_isFront` : the ray `F after a` is a front on `M after a`.
* `Front.IsFront.singleton_mem_tree` : in a nontrivial front (`[] ∉ F`) every `n ∈ M` heads an
  element, i.e. `[n] ∈ tree F`.
* `Front.IsFront.ray_isFront_mem` : for a nontrivial front and `n ∈ M`, `F after n` is a front
  on `M after n`.

## Nontriviality

The trivial front is `{[]}` (rank `0`). For a front, `[] ∉ F`, `F ≠ {[]}`, `⋃ F = M`, and
"`[n] ∈ tree F` for every `n ∈ M`" are all equivalent; `[] ∉ F` is the canonical working flag
(see `IsFront.nil_not_mem_iff`).

/-! ### Rank of the ray

The ray strictly lowers the rank. This is what makes the Nash-Williams recursion well-founded.

The tree of `ray F a` is the subtree of `tree F` sitting above the node `[a]`, transported by
`t ↦ a :: t`; `mem_tree_ray` is the membership bridge (the single point of contact with the
concrete `tree` representation — a later switch to `Descriptive.Tree.subAt` would rewrite only
this lemma). -/
