# Nash-Williams Fronts

Fronts are families of finite sets of natural numbers which generalize the families `[M]^k` of
subsets of size `k ∈ ℕ` for infinite subsets `M ⊆ ℕ`. They enjoy a similar combinatorial
property, an infinite Ramsey theorem, which is the main result of this file.

The explicit definition of a front is relative to an infinite set `M ⊆ ℕ`. A family `F` of
finite subsets of `M` is a front if it satisfies:

1. (Base) Either `F = {∅}` or `⋃ F = M`.
2. (Incomparability) For all `s, t ∈ F`, if `s ⊑ t` then `s = t`.
3. (Density) For all `N ∈ [M]^∞` there exists `t ∈ F` such that `t ⊑ N`.

Here `s ⊑ t` is the *initial-segment* (prefix) relation.

## Encoding (enumeration-first)

Everything is represented through increasing enumerations, so a subset of `ℕ` is its strictly
monotone enumeration and the underlying set is recovered as a `range`.

* An infinite subset of `ℕ` is a `StrictMono` map `N : ℕ → ℕ`; its set is `Set.range N`.
* A finite subset is a sorted list `s : List ℕ`; its set is `{x | x ∈ s}`.
* `IsInit s N` says `s` is the initial segment of the sequence `N`, i.e.
  `s = [N 0, N 1, …, N (s.length - 1)]`. This is `⊑` between (the increasing enumeration of) a
  finite set and an infinite set.
* `⊑` between two finite sets is plain `List.IsPrefix` (`<+:`).
* `[M]^∞`, the infinite subsets of `M`, is exactly the subsequences `M ∘ g` for `StrictMono g`.

## The Schreier front

The Schreier front on `M` consists of the non-empty finite subsets `s ⊆ M` whose size is one
more than the minimal (first) element: `∃ a, s.head? = some a ∧ s.length = a + 1`. It is the first
genuinely non-uniform front — the lists' length varies with where the list starts.
